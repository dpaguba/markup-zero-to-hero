                  The beneficiary of our services is a company part of the top
                  100 Forbes, with more than 100 billions EUR in revenues. They
                  are world leaders in Consumer Electronics, Home Appliances,
                  Home Entertainment, Mobile Communications, Solar and Display
                  Technologies. The challenge was to develop an object detection
                  system for automotive use. This application should identify
                  obstacles and evaluate distances to obstacles, using only one
                  video source from a moving camera. The targeted platform is a
                  mobile and embedded hardware with a monocular vision that
                  should be power efficient in real time.

                  The beneficiary of our services is South Korea’s largest
                  Internet company, operating the country top search portal. The
                  company is fully committed to pioneering state-of-the-art
                  technologies based on their continued research and investment
                  in core development. Many internal services were using Oracle,
                  SQL Server, MySQL. The recurring licensing and support cost
                  was too high. Plus there was a need of DBMS targeted on
                  Korean/Asian markets. So the client decided to make an
                  in-house DBMS. The project’s first stable release dates back
                  to October, 2008. Our team has joined in Jan 2009 and has been
                  working continuously on the project since then.
